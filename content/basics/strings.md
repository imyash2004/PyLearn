# Working with Text (Strings) üìù

Welcome back! Now that you know about variables, let's dive deeper into working with **text** in Python. In programming, we call text "strings" because they're like a string of characters tied together!

## What are Strings?

A **string** is any text that you put inside quotes. Python treats everything inside quotes as text, even if it looks like numbers!

\`\`\`python
# These are all strings
name = "Emma"
message = "Hello, world!"
favorite_color = "rainbow"
even_numbers = "2, 4, 6, 8"  # This is text, not actual numbers!
\`\`\`

## Creating Strings

You can create strings using either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`):

\`\`\`python
# Both of these work the same way
greeting1 = "Hello there!"
greeting2 = 'Hello there!'

# But be consistent in your choice
print(greeting1)  # Output: Hello there!
print(greeting2)  # Output: Hello there!
\`\`\`

### When to Use Which Quotes?

\`\`\`python
# Use double quotes when your text has single quotes (apostrophes)
sentence1 = "I can't wait to learn Python!"

# Use single quotes when your text has double quotes
sentence2 = 'She said, "Python is awesome!"'

# Or use triple quotes for really long text
long_text = """
This is a very long piece of text
that spans multiple lines.
Perfect for stories or explanations!
"""
\`\`\`

## String Operations

### Combining Strings (Concatenation)

You can stick strings together like puzzle pieces:

\`\`\`python
first_name = "Alex"
last_name = "Johnson"

# Method 1: Using the + operator
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)  # Output: Alex Johnson

# Method 2: Using f-strings (the modern way!)
full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
print(full_name)  # Output: Alex Johnson

# Method 3: Using .format()
full_name = "{} {}".format(first_name, last_name)
print(full_name)  # Output: Alex Johnson
\`\`\`

### F-Strings: The Super Cool Way!

F-strings are like magic - you can put variables right inside your text:

\`\`\`python
name = "Maya"
age = 12
favorite_subject = "science"

# Old way (still works, but not as cool)
message = "Hi, I'm " + name + " and I'm " + str(age) + " years old."

# New way with f-strings (much cooler!)
message = f"Hi, I'm {name} and I'm {age} years old."
print(message)  # Output: Hi, I'm Maya and I'm 12 years old.

# You can even do math inside f-strings!
next_year = f"Next year, I'll be {age + 1} years old!"
print(next_year)  # Output: Next year, I'll be 13 years old!
\`\`\`

## String Methods: Cool Tricks!

Strings come with built-in superpowers called **methods**. Here are some fun ones:

### Changing Case

\`\`\`python
message = "python is awesome"

print(message.upper())      # PYTHON IS AWESOME
print(message.lower())      # python is awesome
print(message.title())      # Python Is Awesome
print(message.capitalize()) # Python is awesome
\`\`\`

### Finding Information

\`\`\`python
sentence = "I love learning Python programming"

print(len(sentence))                    # 33 (number of characters)
print(sentence.count("n"))              # 4 (how many times "n" appears)
print(sentence.find("Python"))          # 15 (where "Python" starts)
print("Python" in sentence)            # True (is "Python" in the sentence?)
print("Java" in sentence)              # False
\`\`\`

### Cleaning Up Text

\`\`\`python
messy_text = "   Hello, World!   "

print(messy_text.strip())               # "Hello, World!" (removes spaces)
print(messy_text.replace("World", "Python"))  # "   Hello, Python!   "
\`\`\`

### Splitting and Joining

\`\`\`python
# Split a sentence into words
sentence = "Python is fun and easy"
words = sentence.split()
print(words)  # ['Python', 'is', 'fun', 'and', 'easy']

# Join words back together
new_sentence = " ".join(words)
print(new_sentence)  # "Python is fun and easy"

# Split by different characters
email = "student@school.edu"
parts = email.split("@")
print(parts)  # ['student', 'school.edu']
\`\`\`

## Fun String Projects

### Project 1: Name Formatter

\`\`\`python
# Get user input and format it nicely
first_name = "emma"
last_name = "WILSON"

# Format the names properly
formatted_first = first_name.capitalize()
formatted_last = last_name.capitalize()

full_name = f"{formatted_first} {formatted_last}"
print(f"Formatted name: {full_name}")
# Output: Formatted name: Emma Wilson
\`\`\`

### Project 2: Word Counter

\`\`\`python
story = "Once upon a time, there was a brave knight who loved Python programming"

print(f"Story: {story}")
print(f"Number of characters: {len(story)}")
print(f"Number of words: {len(story.split())}")
print(f"Number of times 'a' appears: {story.lower().count('a')}")
\`\`\`

### Project 3: Secret Message Encoder

\`\`\`python
message = "Python is awesome"
encoded = message.replace("a", "@").replace("e", "3").replace("o", "0")
print(f"Original: {message}")
print(f"Encoded: {encoded}")
# Output: Encoded: Pyth0n is @w3s0m3
\`\`\`

## Interactive Challenges

### Challenge 1: Personal Introduction

Create variables for your information and use f-strings to create a nice introduction:

\`\`\`python
name = "Your Name"
age = 12
hobby = "reading"
favorite_color = "blue"

introduction = f"Hi! My name is {name}. I'm {age} years old, I love {hobby}, and my favorite color is {favorite_color}."
print(introduction)
\`\`\`

### Challenge 2: Text Analyzer

\`\`\`python
text = "Python programming is fun and educational"

# Your turn! Try to:
# 1. Count how many words are in the text
# 2. Find how many times the letter "n" appears
# 3. Convert the text to all uppercase
# 4. Replace "fun" with "amazing"
\`\`\`

### Challenge 3: Email Validator

\`\`\`python
email = "student@pylearn.com"

# Check if the email has "@" and "."
has_at = "@" in email
has_dot = "." in email

if has_at and has_dot:
    print("This looks like a valid email!")
else:
    print("This doesn't look like a valid email.")
\`\`\`

## String Formatting Magic

### Creating Tables

\`\`\`python
name1, age1, grade1 = "Alice", 12, "7th"
name2, age2, grade2 = "Bob", 13, "8th"
name3, age3, grade3 = "Charlie", 11, "6th"

print("Student Report")
print("-" * 30)
print(f"{'Name':<10} {'Age':<5} {'Grade':<5}")
print("-" * 30)
print(f"{name1:<10} {age1:<5} {grade1:<5}")
print(f"{name2:<10} {age2:<5} {grade2:<5}")
print(f"{name3:<10} {age3:<5} {grade3:<5}")
\`\`\`

### Mad Libs Game

\`\`\`python
adjective1 = "silly"
noun1 = "elephant"
verb = "dancing"
adjective2 = "purple"

story = f"""
Once upon a time, there was a {adjective1} {noun1} who loved {verb}.
Every day, the {adjective2} {noun1} would practice {verb} in the forest.
All the other animals thought it was the most {adjective1} thing they had ever seen!
"""

print(story)
\`\`\`

## Common String Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Forgetting Quotes

\`\`\`python
# Wrong:
name = Alex  # This will cause an error!

# Right:
name = "Alex"
\`\`\`

### 2. Mixing Quote Types

\`\`\`python
# Wrong:
message = "Hello, world!'  # Mismatched quotes!

# Right:
message = "Hello, world!"
\`\`\`

### 3. Forgetting to Convert Numbers

\`\`\`python
age = 12

# Wrong:
message = "I am " + age + " years old"  # Error! Can't add string and number

# Right:
message = "I am " + str(age) + " years old"
# Or better yet:
message = f"I am {age} years old"
\`\`\`

## What's Next?

Fantastic work! You now know how to:
- Create and work with strings
- Combine strings in multiple ways
- Use powerful f-strings for formatting
- Apply string methods to manipulate text
- Build fun text-based projects

In our next lesson, we'll learn about **making decisions** with if statements - how to make your programs smart enough to choose what to do based on different situations!

## Fun Fact!

The term "string" in programming comes from the early days of computing when text was thought of as a "string of characters" - like beads on a string! Each character (letter, number, or symbol) is like a bead, and together they form a string of text.

Keep practicing with strings - they're everywhere in programming! üöÄ
